#Difference-Objects-Classes
The concept of object-oriented programming (OOP) has two fundamental concepts: objects and classes. These terms are directly related to each other, but they mean different things. A class is a blue print or a template that stipulates the properties and behaviors that the subsequent objects will possess. It defines variables and processes but does not take up memory until an instance is generated (Oracle, 2024). In plain English, a class defines what something is and what it is capable of doing.

An object, in turn, is a real object that is an instantiated version of an object class run-time. Object are in contrast to classes and can be found in memory and have their own specific data values (Schildt, 2018). As an example, when a class of car has its attributes, say brand and year, then every object made out of that class say car1 or car2 is a real, unique example of a car with its own values of its attributes.

The conceptual divergence may be explained on the example of blueprint analogy: a class is the architectural blueprint itself, and an object is the real building based on the blueprint. A single class can be instantiated more than once to form several objects, which are independent of each other but have the same structure and behavior specified by the class.
